# oriC

Predicting oriC in plasmids and chromosomes.

### The OriC Computational Problem

INPUT :  A DNA string (genome)  
OUTPUT: Location of oriC in it  


### Why is it important to know oriC ?
- To understand cell replication.
- To create biomedical therapies like **viral vectors**

### Bacterial Genome
 Model organism _**Vibrio cholerae**_ with known oriC sequence.  
   
 **How does replication initiate?**  
 Initiation of replication begins with _DnaA_, a protein that binds to   
 a short segemento of the _oriC_ known as the **Dna Box**   
   
 The _DnaA Box_ tells the _DnaA_ to essentially bind there.  
   
 The key question then is to ask:  
 > **How to find this DnaA Box without knowing what it looks like**

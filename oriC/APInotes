NOTE: 
1)linkfile -> keeps a key value pair of NCBI specific file names. This needs to be 
  manually updated by user before running going any further with analysis

2)If util/get_kv.py reports on the stderr -> the requested files for that organism wasn't 
  found in linkfile and hence isn't avaiable on disk or the user could have mistyped.
